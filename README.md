A project done in my free time as course work for my Programming course in uni.
A simple compression algorithm based on my vague knowledge of C, data types, structures and how bytes work and take space on a system. 

--Written in pure C, no external libraries, no GUI

--!!ALGORITHM PERFORMANCE MAY VARY!!
